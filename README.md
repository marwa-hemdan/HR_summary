## üìä HR Analytics Dashboard (Built with Tableau)

#### üß† My Perspective

This project analyzes a fictional HR dataset to explore the **patterns behind employee attrition**. I followed the process from Baraa‚Äôs tutorial but added my own thinking to understand how each visualization helps uncover key HR insights.
---

## üîç Goals of the Analysis

*Understand employee attrition.

*Examine trends in job satisfaction, compensation, and performance.

*Develop interactive dashboards for HR managers.

---

## üß© Dataset Relationships

Through exploration, I noticed the following important **relationships between variables**:

* **Attrition vs Job Satisfaction**: Lower job satisfaction scores often align with higher attrition rates.
* **Monthly Income vs Job Role**: Certain job roles like Managers have significantly higher salaries.
* **Age vs Attrition**: Younger employees tend to leave more frequently.
* **Department vs Work-Life Balance**: Some departments showed consistently lower work-life balance ratings.

## üìà Visuals and Why I Used Them

### 1. **Map Graph**

* **Used for:** Visualizing geographic distribution of employees (if location data is available) to show the total hire of each state and region.
* **Why:** Helps HR see which regions have higher turnover or lower engagement.

### 2. **Bar Charts**
* **Used for:** Comparing attrition across Education vs Age, Bacholar vs Employees,departments vs Hired and Terminated Employees, State vs Employee numbers.
* **Why:** Simple and effective for categorical comparisons.

### 3. **Line Graph**

* **Used for:** Tracking trends over time, such as Terminated or hiring for both gender "female and male".
* **Why:** Shows time-based patterns clearly.

### 4. **Heatmap**

### 5. **Pie Chart / Donut Chart**

* **Used for:** High-level views like attrition rate breakdown.
* **Why:** Gives a quick snapshot of proportions.

## üìå What I Learned

* Designing dashboards isn‚Äôt just about charts‚Äîit‚Äôs about **storytelling through data**
* Relationships between variables often reveal **root causes** of business issues
* Color, layout, and filters matter a lot in making dashboards **user-friendly**


## üôè Acknowledgment

Tutorial by [Baraa on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcGF09Awm4Y) inspired this project. I followed his structure but applied my own analysis and insights throughout.
